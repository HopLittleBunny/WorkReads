What is WorkReads?

WorkReads is a professional signal engine built for decision-makers navigating information overload.

Instead of amplifying popularity, WorkReads evaluates each insight using structured metrics — then delivers a ranked, distilled feed designed to improve decision quality per minute spent reading.

WorkReads is not a news app.
It is not a social feed.
It is reading intelligence.

The Three Metrics

Every item is evaluated using:

Quality — credibility, clarity, and strength of reasoning
Relevance — fit for your role, function, and interaction signals
Freshness — timeliness and strategic usefulness right now

These signals determine what appears in your feed — and in what order.

How It Works
Rank

Each item is evaluated across Quality · Relevance · Freshness before it appears.

Distill

You receive an Intelligence Brief — a concise, structured summary designed for clarity and action.

Personalize

Your profile (role, function, country) and interaction signals (saves, ratings, follows, time spent reading) continuously refine what you see.

Follow trusted people

Follow leaders and authors to build a signal-rich professional knowledge network.

Save & reflect

Save items to your Library and capture takeaways in your Journal.

Content & Sources

WorkReads surfaces publicly available professional articles and insights.

We do not republish full copyrighted articles.

We provide a direct external link to the original publisher so you can read the full source.

Intelligence Briefs are transformative summaries designed to support faster comprehension — not substitutes for original content.

Privacy & Data

An account is used to personalize relevance scoring.

WorkReads may store:

Basic profile information (e.g., name, role; organization optional)

Interaction signals (e.g., saves, ratings, follows, time spent reading)

Generated outputs (e.g., Intelligence Brief summaries + metadata)

We do not sell personal data.
We do not run ads.
We do not track you across other apps.

You may delete your account at any time via Profile → Delete Account or by contacting:

AI Usage

WorkReads uses AI (including Google Gemini) to:

Generate structured Intelligence Brief summaries

Improve clarity and organization

Support relevance modeling

When AI services are used:

Publicly available content text and contextual metadata may be processed

Personal identity information (such as name or email) is not transmitted for summarization

AI-generated summaries are informational and designed to support faster understanding — not professional advice.

## What is WorkReads?

WorkReads is a **professional signal engine** that helps you make better decisions in a noisy information environment.

Instead of amplifying popularity, WorkReads evaluates each insight using three structured metrics — then delivers a ranked, distilled feed designed to improve **decision quality per minute spent reading**.

WorkReads is not a news app.  
It is not a social feed.  
It is **reading intelligence**.

---

## The three metrics

WorkReads scores every item using:

- **Quality** — credibility, clarity, and strength of reasoning  
- **Relevance** — fit for your role, function, and reading signals  
- **Freshness** — timeliness and strategic usefulness *right now*

These signals drive what appears in your feed — and in what order.

---

## How it works

1. **Rank**  
   Every item is evaluated across **Quality · Relevance · Freshness** before it appears.

2. **Distill**  
   You get an **Intelligence Brief** — a concise summary designed for clarity and action.

3. **Personalize**  
   Your profile (role, function, country) and interactions (saves, ratings, follows) continuously refine what you see.

4. **Follow trusted people**  
   Follow leaders and authors to build a signal-rich professional knowledge network.

5. **Save & reflect**  
   Save items to your Library and capture takeaways in your Journal.
